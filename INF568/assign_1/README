1. My program that calculates shake 256 digests is wrapped around two functions.
The first one is shake_256(raw_msg, digest_len), which takes in a raw
binary-string message and intended digest length, and outputs a tuple of shake
256 (hexdigest, binarydigest). The second one is shake_256_from_file(f_name,
digest_len), which takes in a file name and digest length, calculates the
shake-256 digest on the file content, and its outputs are in the same format as
shake_256.

2. To find collisions, I wrote two functions, of which both take in the number
of input bits and number of output bits as arguments. The first one,
find_collisions_naive, attempts at finding the collisions using brute-force,
whereas the second one, find_collisions_sqrt finds the collisions using the
floyd-detecting algorithm discussed in class.

3. Metrics:
Average time for each 8-collision: around 0.1 sec
Average time for each 16-collision: around 1 sec
Average time for each 24-collision: 190+1194+34+47/4 = 1429.75 secs = 23.8 mins
Average time for each 32-collision: 2616 secs = 43.6 mins
