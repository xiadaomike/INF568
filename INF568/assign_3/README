Code is tested with python3.6.0. Packages needed to run:
** bitarray: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitarray
** numpy

Fucntion named test_edouard on line 120 shows an example of how to use the LPS
class for encryption and decryption. The function itself first tests encryption
and decryption by encrypting the edouard data file, decrypting the
produced ciphertext, and then checks it gets back the original "edouard"
plaintext. The function then uses its self-generated public and private keys for
encryption and decryption instead of the given one. For object serialization I
used json.

**Note: the test_edouard function assumes the test vectors are under the same
directory as the code file.
