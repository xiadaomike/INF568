Language: Python2, and Python3 (except the X25519 part, see the explanation
below)

For small tests on the montgomery ladder, uncomment line 65 in the code.
For small tests on X25519, uncomment line 117 in the code. (Note: this test only
works with PYTHON2 because of hex encoding method deprecations)

The factorization program first uses the trial_division function to find small
prime factors, and then prints out the left-over number that needs to be
factored into large primes. For each 10 curves that the ECMTrial function uses,
a curve index is printed once.

Uncomment lines 180-185 to see that the curve parameterization works.

My code seems to factor the first challenge number without any problem, yet it
struggles with the rest challenges. To try the factorization with different
numbers, simply modify the number on the last line.
